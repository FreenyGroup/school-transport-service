    question: 'Where do you get drivers from?',
    ans: 'School Transport Services drivers are members of the local communities we serve. Many come from backgrounds such as parenting, teaching, school support roles, social work, or childcare. Drivers often join our platform through referrals from friends, family, and school partners, as well as through word of mouth and social media.',

    question: 'What kind of background checks do drivers go through?',
    ans: 'School Transport Services drivers undergo a rigorous certification process that includes extensive background checks. These checks cover county, state, and national criminal records, global watchlist and sex offender registry screenings, driving history reviews, fingerprinting, and child abuse and neglect screenings. Every driver is carefully vetted to ensure they meet our high standards for safety and trust.',

    question: 'Do drivers use their own vehicles',
    ans: 'Yes, drivers use their own vehicles, which must meet strict School Transport Services standards. To be approved for use on the platform, a driver must own or lease a vehicle that is no more than 15 years old (with some exceptions by region), has up-to-date registration, and passes an annual inspection by a certified mechanic. Vehicles must also meet all applicable state and industry regulations, be in good working condition, have four doors, and accommodate four to seven passengers. **Note: In DC, MD, PA, and Certain parts of VA, vehicles must be 10 years old or newer.',

    question: 'Can I get a consistent driver?',
    ans: 'While we can’t guarantee the same driver every time, consistency is something we work hard to provide. Because our model is built around driver availability, some variation is natural — but many drivers choose routes they’re familiar with, especially for recurring Ride Series. As a result, riders often do see the same few drivers regularly. In fact, most riders are matched with only about three different drivers over a 90-day period. Even when the driver changes, every ride is designed to feel consistent and safe, thanks to our standardized processes and training.',

    question:
      'How will school staff or parents identify the vehicles for School Transport Services rides?',
    ans: 'All School Transport Services vehicles—whether standard or wheelchair-accessible—are clearly marked with orange decals in both the front and rear windshields. Caregivers receive a notification when the driver arrives, along with the driver’s name and a photo of the vehicle. School staff can also view ride details in the Daily Queue for added visibility and coordination.',

    question: 'Can you accommodate students with disabilities?',
    ans: 'Yes, School Transport Services works with districts nationwide to provide transportation for students with disabilities or those who need additional support. We offer individualized transportation options—including wheelchair-accessible vehicles (WAVs) and trained Rider Assistants—tailored to each student’s specific needs to ensure safe, comfortable, and reliable rides.',
